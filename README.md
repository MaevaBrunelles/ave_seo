## Installation

This plugin can be installed via:

    pip install pelican-seo

## Requirements

SEO needs Beautiful Soup 4 :

```
pip install bs4
```

`SITEURL` Pelican parameter must be defined as features are based on it.

## Usage

You can choose which feature to enable or disable in the plugin settings. Default is `True` for both.

```
# settings.py
SEO_REPORT = True # To enable this feature
SEO_ENHANCER = False # To disable this feature
```

SEO runs when you [generate your site](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/quickstart.html#generate-your-site). If you want to see SEO logs, you should use `--verbose` Pelican argument:
```
$ pelican content --verbose
-> SEO plugin initialized
-> SEO plugin - SEO Report: seo_report.html file created
-> SEO plugin - SEO Enhancement: robots.txt file created
-> Writing /output/my-first-review.html
-> SEO plugin - SEO Enhancement: Done for /output/my-first-review.html
Done: Processed 1 articles, 0 drafts, 0 pages, 0 hidden pages and 0 draft pages in 0.17 seconds.
```

### SEO report

SEO analyzes all your articles and pages, and generate an HTML SEO report in your Pelican root project : `seo-report.html`

Example :

![SEO report example](docs/seo-report-example.png)

You can set up a limit for article and page analysis in the plugin settings.py. By default, it's set up to 10 articles and 10 pages.

```
ARTICLES_LIMIT = 10
PAGES_LIMIT = 10
```

The analysis works from the most recents articles or pages to the olders according to the `date` metadata. 
Analysis is focused on :
* Page title `<title></title>`
* Page description `<meta name="description" content="" />`
* Title content `<h1></h1>`
* Internal link `<a href="SITEURL/..."></a>`

Which are declared by article and page metadata and content :

```markdown
# article.md
Title: Title page
Description: Description page

# Title content
[Internal link](https://example.com/about.html)
```

Theses elements form the basis of page SEO optimization. Have a look to the report, optimize your articles and pages according to analysis, and restart the process to see if all elements are now in green. 

### SEO Enhancer

SEO generates for you : 
* HTML enhancements 
* Structured data
* Robots file

#### Robots.txt file

Indicates to search engines which pages they are allowed to access to or not. By default, all pages are authorized to be explored by all the existing robots.

```
User-agent: *
```

To disallow the exploration or to forbid the indexation of a specific ressource, add theses metadata :

```
Disallow: True
Noindex: True
```

A `robots.txt` file is added at the website root, in the `OUTPUT_PATH` setting (Pelican's default is `output/`).

```
# robots.txt
User-agent: *

Disallow: example.html
Noindex: other-example.html
```

#### Canonical URL tag

SEO automatically adds for each article the canonical URL tag in the `<head>` to avoid duplicate content.

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="<SITEURL>/example.html" />
```

#### Structured data

SEO automatically adds structured data in the `<head>` to improve the display of result snippet in search engines. Articles will have both article schema and breadcrumb schema, while pages will only have breadcrumb schema.
Structured data are based on [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) vocabulary, with `JSON-LD` encoding. Note that schemas generated by default are Schema.org compliant, but not automatically Google compliant. Additionnal metadata are required for it.

##### Breadcrumb schema

Based on [BreadcrumbList schema](https://schema.org/BreadcrumbList) :

```
{
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
    "itemListElement": [
        {
            "@type": "ListItem",
            "position": :n=1:,
            "name": :Sitename:,
            "item": :SITEURL:
        },
        {
            "@type": "ListItem",
            "position": :n+1:,
            "name": :name:,
            "item": :url:
        },
        {
            "@type": "ListItem",
            "position": :n+x:,
            "name": :name:,
            "item": :url:
        }
    ]
}
```

Each element of the file path has his `ListItem`, even folders, so it's better to create a user friendly page for those (otherwise you'll get your server's default page). 

##### Article schema

Based on [Article schema](https://schema.org/Article) :

```
{
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Article",
    "author": {
        "@type": "Person",
        "name": :author:
    },
    "publisher": {
        "@type": "Organization",
        "name": :sitename:,
        "logo": {
            "@type": "ImageObject",
            "url": :logo:
        }
    },
    "headline": :title:,
    "about": :category:,
    "datePublished": :publication_date:,
    "image": :image:
}
```

`:logo:` and `:image:` fields are not required by Schema.org but they are by Google. 

To fill `:logo:`, add a parameter in the `pelicanconf.py` :

```
# pelicanconf.py
LOGO = 'https://www.example.com/logo.jpg'
```

To fill `:image:`, add a metadata for each Markdown or reST article :

```
# article.md
Image: https://www.example.com/article-image.jpg

# article.rst
:image: https://www.example.com/article-image.jpg
```
