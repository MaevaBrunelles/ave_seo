# Pelican SEO plugin: deprecated version

This version of Pelican SEO was created to work with Pelican 3.6 and https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins, which will be deprecated with the Pelican 4.5 version.

The master branch handles the new layout of Pelican plugins, but if you want to install this plugin, you must use the official release: https://github.com/pelican-plugins/seo

This branch is no longer supported.
